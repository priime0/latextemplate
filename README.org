#+title: LaTeX Template
#+author: Lucas Sta Maria

My LaTeX template for lectures and homeworks, with custom math commands and lecture macros I've found myself needing.

* Set up

For a new project, simply clone the directory.

#+begin_src sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/priime0/latextemplate
#+end_src

If you'd like to make the math operators global, you can symlink or copy the package file into your custom directory.

#+begin_src sh
# First argument is the path to this repository's `priimemath.sty' file.
# Second argument is the path to your common LaTeX package directory.
# Replace `ln -s' with `cp' if you prefer to copy rather than link.
ln -s ./priimemath.sty ~/texmf/tex/latex/commonstuff/priimemath.sty
#+end_src

* Running

I use [[https://github.com/casey/just][just]] to run my LaTeX commands.

 * ~just run~: compile =main.tex= to =out/main.pdf=.
 * ~just clean~: clean the contents of  =out/=.
